Install **node.js**. Then **gulp** and **bower** if you haven't yet.

    $ npm -g install gulp bower

Install bower and npm dependencies, and run your code in development mode.

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ gulp serve

When you are ready to build a production release there is a task for that:

    $ gulp build:dist

This task will lint your code, optimize css js and images files. After the task has successfully finished, you can find an optimized version of your project inside the  `/build/dist` folder.

To test the distribution release:

    $ gulp serve:dist

To get all the exportable assets from sketch: (You will need the [Sketch Tool](https://www.sketchapp.com/tool/))

    $ gulp sketch
